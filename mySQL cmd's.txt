To reset the auto-increment
- this can happen after deleting rows, without a server restart the rows will keep autoincrementing from the last entry.

Steps:
1. delete unwanted rows
2. find the highest value:
SELECT MAX( `id` ) FROM `student` ;
result: 9
so after all deletions you might be left with 9 rows
3. reset the auto-increment to new next row:
ALTER TABLE `student` AUTO_INCREMENT = 10;
