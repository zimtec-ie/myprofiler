Sometimes the port 8080 remains open from running the StudentsystemApplication so to close it manually, use these commands in the Command Prompt or PowerShell:

To find which process Id's or PID are listening:
> netstat -ano | findstr 8080

Grab the PID and put it in place of <PID>:
> taskkill /F /PID <PID>

To find out your IP:
> ipconfig /all
